Concurrency and parallelism are two related but distinct concepts in programming, especially in the context of multithreading and multitasking.

### Concurrency:
- **Definition**: Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time by interleaving their execution. It does not necessarily mean tasks are running simultaneously.
- **Key Idea**: Tasks make progress by sharing time on a single processor or multiple processors.
- **Example**: A single-core CPU switching between multiple threads to give the illusion of simultaneous execution.

#### Example in Java:
```java
public class ConcurrencyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            // Task 1
            System.out.println("Task 1 running");
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            // Task 2
            System.out.println("Task 2 running");
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

### Parallelism:
- **Definition**: Parallelism is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple processors or cores.
- **Key Idea**: Tasks are executed truly at the same time.
- **Example**: A multi-core CPU running multiple threads simultaneously.

#### Example in Java:
```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntStream.range(1, 5).parallel().forEach(i -> {
            System.out.println("Task " + i + " running on thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });
    }
}
```

### Key Differences:
| Aspect                | Concurrency                          | Parallelism                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Execution**         | Tasks are interleaved                | Tasks are executed simultaneously     |
| **Hardware**          | Can occur on a single processor       | Requires multiple processors/cores    |
| **Goal**              | Improve responsiveness               | Improve throughput                    |

### Use Cases:
- **Concurrency**: Useful for tasks like I/O operations where tasks can wait and switch efficiently.
- **Parallelism**: Useful for CPU-intensive tasks like data processing or mathematical computations.

### Analogy:
- **Concurrency**: A single cashier handling multiple customers by switching between them.
- **Parallelism**: Multiple cashiers handling multiple customers simultaneously.
