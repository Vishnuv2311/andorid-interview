The garbage collector (GC) is a part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) responsible for automatic memory management. It identifies and removes objects that are no longer in use by the application, freeing up memory for future allocations.

### How it works:
1. **Object Allocation**: When an object is created, it is allocated memory in the heap.
2. **Reachability Analysis**: The GC periodically performs a reachability analysis to determine which objects are still accessible from the root references (e.g., static fields, local variables, etc.).
3. **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**:
   - **Mark Phase**: The GC marks all reachable objects starting from the root references.
   - **Sweep Phase**: It removes all unmarked (unreachable) objects and reclaims their memory.
4. **Compaction (Optional)**: Some GCs compact the heap to reduce fragmentation and improve memory allocation efficiency.
5. **Generational Collection**: Modern GCs divide the heap into generations (Young, Old, and sometimes Permanent) to optimize performance. Objects are initially allocated in the Young Generation and promoted to the Old Generation if they survive multiple GC cycles.

### Benefits:
- Reduces the risk of memory leaks.
- Simplifies memory management for developers.

### Limitations:
- GC introduces overhead, which can impact application performance during collection cycles.
- Developers still need to avoid holding unnecessary references to objects to ensure they are eligible for collection.
