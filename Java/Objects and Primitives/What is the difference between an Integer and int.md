`int`:
- `int` is a primitive data type in Java.
- It is used to store integer values.
- It is more memory-efficient and faster as it directly stores the value.
- Cannot be null, as it always holds a value.

`Integer`:
- `Integer` is a wrapper class in Java, part of the `java.lang` package.
- It is used to represent an `int` value as an object.
- Supports methods and can be used in collections like `ArrayList` that require objects.
- Can be null, which is useful in certain scenarios like database operations.

Key Differences:
- `int` is a primitive type, while `Integer` is an object.
- `Integer` provides additional functionality through methods, whereas `int` is limited to basic arithmetic operations.
- `Integer` consumes more memory and is slower due to object overhead.
