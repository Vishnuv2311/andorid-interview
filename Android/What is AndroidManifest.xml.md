# What is AndroidManifest.xml?

The `AndroidManifest.xml` file is an essential part of every Android application. It acts as a blueprint for the Android system to understand the app’s structure and functionalities. This file provides critical information such as:

- **Package Name**: The unique identifier for the application.
- **Components**: Declares all components like Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers.
- **Permissions**: Specifies the permissions required by the app (e.g., Internet access, Camera usage).
- **Hardware & Software Features**: Declares device-specific requirements like GPS, Bluetooth, or minimum API level.
- **Intent Filters**: Defines how the app interacts with the system and other apps.
- **Metadata**: Allows configuration of third-party services like Google Maps or Firebase.

The `AndroidManifest.xml` file ensures that the Android system correctly registers and initializes the app’s components and enforces security policies.
