# What is SnapHelper in Android?

`SnapHelper` is a utility class in Android that helps to align items in a `RecyclerView` smoothly when scrolling stops. It ensures that the items in a `RecyclerView` always snap to a specific position, improving the user experience.

## Types of SnapHelpers
Android provides two built-in implementations of `SnapHelper`:
  
1. **LinearSnapHelper** - Snaps to the closest item in a `RecyclerView` with a `LinearLayoutManager`.
2. **PagerSnapHelper** - Works like a `ViewPager`, snapping to one item at a time.

## Usage
To use a `SnapHelper`, simply attach it to a `RecyclerView` with a `LayoutManager`.

```kotlin
val recyclerView: RecyclerView = findViewById(R.id.recyclerView)
val snapHelper = LinearSnapHelper()
snapHelper.attachToRecyclerView(recyclerView)
```

## Custom SnapHelper
You can create a custom `SnapHelper` by extending the `SnapHelper` class and overriding its methods.

## Benefits
- Provides smooth scrolling and snapping behavior.
- Enhances user experience by ensuring items are properly aligned.
- Useful for implementing carousel-like effects.
