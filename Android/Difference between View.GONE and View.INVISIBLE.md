# Difference between View.GONE and View.INVISIBLE in Android

In Android, `View.GONE` and `View.INVISIBLE` are two visibility states that control the presence of a view in the layout.

## 1. View.GONE
- The view is completely removed from the layout.
- It does not take up any space in the layout.
- Other views may shift to occupy the space that was taken by the view.
- Example:
  ```kotlin
  view.visibility = View.GONE
  ```

## 2. View.INVISIBLE
- The view is hidden but still occupies space in the layout.
- Other views do not move to take its place.
- Example:
  ```kotlin
  view.visibility = View.INVISIBLE
  ```

## Key Differences
| Property       | View.GONE         | View.INVISIBLE |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Visibility    | Completely removed from layout | Hidden but still occupies space |
| Space in Layout | No space taken | Space is reserved |
| Layout reflow | Affects layout and may cause a reflow | Does not affect layout |

## When to Use?
- Use `View.GONE` when you want to completely remove the view and allow other views to adjust.
- Use `View.INVISIBLE` when you want to hide the view but maintain the original layout structure.
