 ## What is ANR?
 ANR (Application Not Responding) occurs in Android when the main thread is blocked for too long, making the UI unresponsive. If an app does not respond to user input within 5 seconds, the system displays an ANR dialog, giving users the option to wait or force close the app.
 
 ## How to Prevent ANR?
 1. **Move Heavy Operations Off the Main Thread**  
    - Use background threads (e.g., `HandlerThread`, `Executors`, `Coroutines`) for intensive tasks like network calls, database operations, or file I/O.
 
 2. **Use Async Processing**  
    - Leverage `AsyncTask`, `CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO)`, or `WorkManager` for long-running operations.
 
 3. **Optimize Database Queries**  
    - Use indexes and optimize SQL queries to prevent delays in UI rendering.
 
 4. **Reduce UI Workload**  
    - Avoid excessive layout nesting and complex views that slow down rendering.
 
 5. **Use Loaders and Paging**  
    - Use `Paging 3` for efficient loading of large datasets and `LiveData` to observe changes.
 
 6. **Avoid Blocking UI Thread**  
    - Never use `Thread.sleep()` or long computations in `onCreate()`, `onResume()`, or other UI lifecycle methods.
 
 7. **Monitor Performance**  
    - Use `StrictMode`, `Profiler`, and `systrace` to detect slow operations and optimize performance.
 
 By implementing these strategies, ANRs can be minimized, ensuring a smooth user experience.
