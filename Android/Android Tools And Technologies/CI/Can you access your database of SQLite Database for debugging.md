Yes, you can access your SQLite database for debugging in Android using the following methods:

### 1. **Using Device File Explorer (Android Studio)**
- Go to `View` > `Tool Windows` > `Device File Explorer`.
- Navigate to `/data/data/<your_package_name>/databases/`.
- You will find your `.db` file here.
- You can right-click and download the database file to inspect it with tools like DB Browser for SQLite.

### 2. **Using ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**
- Open terminal or command prompt.
- Run `adb shell`.
- Navigate to your appâ€™s database path: `cd /data/data/<your_package_name>/databases/`
- Use commands like `sqlite3 your_db_name.db` to interact with the database.

### 3. **Storing Database on External Storage for Easier Access**
- Copy your database to external storage for easier access:
  ```kotlin
  val dbPath = getDatabasePath("your_db_name.db").absolutePath
  val outPath = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().absolutePath + "/your_db_name.db"
  File(dbPath).copyTo(File(outPath), overwrite = true)
  ```
  - Note: Requires storage permission.

### 4. **Use Stetho by Facebook**
- Integrate [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/) in your app for Chrome-based inspection:
  ```kotlin
  Stetho.initializeWithDefaults(this)
  ```
  - Then open Chrome and go to `chrome://inspect`.

### Important Notes:
- Debug database access is only allowed in debug builds.
- Root access may be required for certain devices.
