# What is Lint? What is it used for?

**Lint** is a static code analysis tool used to identify potential issues in Android project source code. It helps developers improve code quality by detecting bugs, performance issues, usability problems, security vulnerabilities, and coding style violations before the app is run.

## Uses of Lint:
- **Code Quality**: Highlights unused resources, deprecated methods, and code that might cause runtime issues.
- **Performance**: Identifies performance bottlenecks such as memory leaks or inefficient layouts.
- **Security**: Flags potential security risks like insecure web views or unprotected intents.
- **Accessibility**: Checks if your UI is usable by users with disabilities (e.g., missing content descriptions).
- **Correctness**: Ensures best practices and correct usage of Android APIs.
- **Internationalization**: Detects hardcoded strings and ensures proper language support.

## Integration
Lint is integrated into Android Studio and Gradle, allowing developers to run checks during builds or directly within the IDE.

## Custom Lint Rules
Developers can also create custom lint checks to enforce team-specific coding guidelines.
