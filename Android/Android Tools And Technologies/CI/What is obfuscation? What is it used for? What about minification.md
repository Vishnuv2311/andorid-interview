## What is Obfuscation?

Obfuscation is the process of transforming code into a form that is difficult for humans to understand. While the code remains functionally the same and can still be executed by the machine, its structure, variable names, and logic are modified to prevent reverse engineering and intellectual property theft.

### Uses of Obfuscation
- Protecting source code from being easily understood or stolen.
- Preventing malicious users from modifying or repurposing your application.
- Making reverse engineering of APKs much harder.

Common tools: ProGuard, R8

## What is Minification?

Minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from the source code without changing its functionality. This includes things like white spaces, comments, and shortening variable names.

### Uses of Minification
- Reducing the size of the application (APK/AAB).
- Improving loading and runtime performance.
- Preparing code for production.

> Note: Obfuscation and minification often occur together during a release build to ensure security and performance.
