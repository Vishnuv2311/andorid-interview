## About Gradle Build System

Gradle is an advanced build automation tool used in Android development for compiling, linking, and packaging applications. It is the default build system for Android Studio and offers powerful features such as incremental builds, dependency management, and customizable build configurations.

### Key Features of Gradle
- **Incremental Builds:** Gradle optimizes build time by compiling only the parts of the project that have changed.
- **Dependency Management:** Gradle supports Maven and Ivy repositories to fetch and manage dependencies.
- **Multi-Module Projects:** Supports large-scale applications by allowing modular builds.
- **Flexible Plugin System:** Gradle plugins (like the Android Gradle Plugin) enhance its functionality and allow custom logic.
- **Build Variants:** Enables creation of different versions (like debug and release) with different configurations.
- **Task-Based:** Build logic is encapsulated in tasks that can be configured and executed individually or in groups.

### Gradle Files in Android
- **`build.gradle (Project-level)`**: Configures build settings that apply to all modules (e.g., repositories, classpaths).
- **`build.gradle (Module-level)`**: Defines application ID, dependencies, build types, product flavors, etc.
- **`gradle.properties`**: Used for defining configuration properties such as JVM arguments or sensitive keys.
- **`settings.gradle`**: Lists modules that are included in the project.

Gradle supports both Groovy and Kotlin DSLs to define build scripts, giving flexibility and readability. Its power and extensibility make it suitable for any complex build scenario in Android development.
