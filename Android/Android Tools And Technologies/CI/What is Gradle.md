## What is Gradle?

Gradle is an advanced build automation tool used primarily for Java-based projects, including Android development. It is designed to be flexible, scalable, and extensible, allowing developers to define custom build logic using a Groovy or Kotlin DSL (Domain-Specific Language).

Gradle handles tasks such as compiling code, packaging APKs, running tests, generating documentation, and managing dependencies. It supports incremental builds and caching to improve performance.

### Why use Gradle in Android?

- **Dependency management**: Easily declare external libraries and manage versions.
- **Build variants**: Create different versions of your app (e.g., debug, release) with minimal duplication.
- **Integration with Android Studio**: Gradle is tightly integrated with Android Studio, providing a seamless development experience.
- **Custom tasks**: You can create and automate custom build tasks specific to your project's needs.
- **Plugin system**: Gradle supports plugins (like the Android Gradle Plugin) that simplify complex build configurations.

Gradle has become the standard build system for Android because of its power and flexibility.
