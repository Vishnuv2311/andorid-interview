# CI/CD Pipeline for Android

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying Android applications. It ensures rapid and reliable delivery of features and bug fixes.

## Key Stages in CI/CD for Android

### 1. **Code Commit**
Developers push code to a version control system like Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### 2. **Build Stage**
- Uses Gradle to build the app.
- Can be triggered by services like GitHub Actions, Bitrise, CircleCI, or Jenkins.
- Caches dependencies for faster builds.

### 3. **Unit Testing**
- Runs local unit tests using JUnit.
- Mocking with Mockito, Robolectric, etc.

### 4. **Lint Checks and Static Analysis**
- Run Android Lint, Detekt, or SonarQube.
- Ensures code quality and style adherence.

### 5. **Instrumentation Testing**
- Executes tests on emulators or Firebase Test Lab.

### 6. **Code Coverage Report**
- Generated using JaCoCo.
- Measures how much of the code is covered by tests.

### 7. **Build Artifacts**
- APKs or AABs are generated and archived.

### 8. **Deployment**
- Internal testing: Upload to internal testers via Firebase App Distribution or Play Console.
- Production: Push to Play Store with versioning and changelogs.

### 9. **Notifications**
- Integrate with Slack, email, or Teams to notify about build status.

## Tools Commonly Used
- **CI/CD Services:** GitHub Actions, Bitrise, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab CI
- **Testing:** JUnit, Espresso, Mockito, Robolectric, Firebase Test Lab
- **Distribution:** Firebase App Distribution, Google Play Console
- **Monitoring:** Crashlytics, App Center

## Best Practices
- Keep builds fast and reliable.
- Run tests in parallel.
- Automate as much as possible.
- Fail fast and notify the team.
- Store secrets securely using environment variables or secret managers.

A well-implemented CI/CD pipeline enhances development efficiency, catches bugs early, and improves overall app quality.
