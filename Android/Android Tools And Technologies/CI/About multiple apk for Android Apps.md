# About Multiple APK for Android Apps

Multiple APK support in Android allows developers to create different APKs for different device configurations without having to create and maintain completely separate projects. This is especially useful for optimizing the APK size and targeting specific device features.

## Why Use Multiple APKs?

1. **Device Compatibility**: Different APKs can target specific API levels, screen sizes, or hardware features.
2. **Reduced APK Size**: By only including the resources and code needed for a particular device configuration, the overall APK size is reduced.
3. **Localized Content**: Allows different APKs to contain localized resources or features depending on the region.

## Types of APK Variants

- **Screen Density-Based APKs**: Target specific screen densities (hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, etc.).
- **ABI-Based APKs**: Target specific CPU architectures (armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, etc.).
- **API-Level-Based APKs**: Target specific Android API levels.
- **Locale-Based APKs**: Include resources for specific languages or regions.

## How to Implement

Multiple APKs can be configured in the `build.gradle` file using the `splits` block:

```groovy
android {
    ...
    splits {
        abi {
            enable true
            reset()
            include 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'
            universalApk false
        }
        density {
            enable true
            reset()
            include "hdpi", "xhdpi", "xxhdpi"
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use the Android App Bundle format when possible; it allows Play Store to handle APK generation and distribution automatically.
- Only create multiple APKs when absolutely necessary, as maintaining many variants can become complex.
- Use version codes intelligently to differentiate APKs.

## Conclusion

Multiple APKs provide fine-grained control over app distribution, improving performance and reducing app size for end users. However, for most use cases, Android App Bundles are now the recommended approach as they offer similar benefits with less complexity.
