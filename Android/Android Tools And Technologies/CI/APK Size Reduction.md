 Reducing the size of an Android APK is crucial for improving app performance, download speed, and user experience. Here are some techniques:
 
 ## 1. Use ProGuard / R8
 - Remove unused code, classes, methods, and fields.
 - Shrinks and optimizes bytecode.
 - `minifyEnabled true` and `shrinkResources true` in `build.gradle`.
 
 ## 2. Enable Resource Shrinking
 - Removes unused resources during build time.
 - Works best when used with code shrinking (ProGuard or R8).
 
 ## 3. Use Android App Bundles (.aab)
 - Distributes optimized APKs for each device configuration.
 - Reduces download and install size on user devices.
 
 ## 4. Avoid Redundant Resources
 - Minimize use of large drawable assets.
 - Use vector drawables instead of PNGs.
 - Remove unused languages, screen sizes, or densities.
 
 ## 5. Compress PNG and JPEG Files
 - Use tools like `pngcrush`, `zopfli`, `webp`.
 - Consider converting images to `.webp` format.
 
 ## 6. Dynamic Feature Modules
 - Separate features into modules that can be downloaded on demand.
 
 ## 7. Remove Debug Information
 - Use `debuggable false` and `jniDebuggable false` in release builds.
 
 ## 8. Optimize Native Libraries
 - Only include required ABIs (e.g., `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`).
 - Use `abiFilters` in `build.gradle`.
 
 ## 9. Avoid Enumerations
 - Enums are heavier than constants or integers.
 - Replace enums with `@IntDef` or `@StringDef`.
 
 ## 10. Analyze APK
 - Use Android Studioâ€™s APK Analyzer to inspect contents and size contributions.
 
 ## Best Practices
 - Regularly audit APK size using CI builds.
 - Monitor libraries and dependencies.
 - Use dependency stripping and deduplication techniques.
