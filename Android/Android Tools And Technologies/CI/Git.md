# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code during software development. It enables multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.

## Key Features
- **Distributed architecture**: Every developer has a local copy of the entire project history.
- **Branching and Merging**: Supports lightweight branching and merging strategies.
- **Data Integrity**: Every file and commit is checksummed.
- **Speed**: Most operations are performed locally, making Git fast.

## Common Git Commands
- `git init` – Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository>` – Clone an existing repository.
- `git status` – View the status of your working directory.
- `git add <file>` – Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"` – Commit changes with a message.
- `git push` – Push changes to the remote repository.
- `git pull` – Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.
- `git branch` – List or create branches.
- `git checkout <branch>` – Switch to a different branch.
- `git merge <branch>` – Merge another branch into the current one.

## Best Practices
- Commit often with meaningful messages.
- Use feature branches for development.
- Regularly pull from the main branch to stay updated.
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing unnecessary files.

Git is foundational to collaborative development and is widely used in the industry for managing codebases of all sizes.
