# How to Change Some Parameters in an App Without App Update

Sometimes it's necessary to change behavior or configuration in an app without publishing a new version to the Play Store. Here are common approaches to achieve this:

## 1. Firebase Remote Config
- Firebase Remote Config allows you to change values in real-time from the Firebase console.
- You define default values in the app, and these can be overridden from the server.
- Ideal for toggling features, changing UI messages, or tuning parameters.

## 2. Feature Flags
- Use feature flag management services (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Firebase Remote Config) to toggle features dynamically.
- Great for A/B testing and gradual rollouts.

## 3. Server-Driven Configuration
- Host configuration values (e.g., JSON or XML) on your backend or CDN.
- The app fetches and parses these values at runtime.

## 4. Environment-Based Configuration
- Maintain multiple configurations in different environments (staging, production).
- App reads from appropriate config based on the build type or user segment.

## 5. App Links and Deep Links
- Dynamically change app behavior or navigation by updating server-side links that the app interprets.

## 6. Firebase A/B Testing
- Combine Remote Config with Firebase A/B Testing to roll out different parameter values to segments.

## Best Practices
- Always define sane defaults in the app.
- Secure any externally loaded configuration.
- Use caching and fallback mechanisms for reliability.
