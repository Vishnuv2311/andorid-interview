# How to Create Custom Layouts in Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose allows you to create custom layouts by defining how composables are measured and positioned. This provides flexibility to design layouts that are not covered by the built-in layout composables.

## Steps to Create a Custom Layout

1. **Use the `Layout` Composable**:
   - The `Layout` composable allows you to define custom measurement and placement logic.
2. **Measure Children**:
   - Measure child composables with constraints.
3. **Position Children**:
   - Define how child composables are positioned within the parent layout.

## Example: Custom Layout

### Custom Layout: Overlapping Texts
This example creates a layout where two texts overlap.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun OverlappingTextLayout(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    text1: String,
    text2: String
) {
    Layout(
        modifier = modifier,
        content = {
            Text(text1)
            Text(text2)
        }
    ) { measurables, constraints ->
        // Measure children
        val placeables = measurables.map { it.measure(constraints) }

        // Determine the size of the layout
        val width = placeables.maxOf { it.width }
        val height = placeables.maxOf { it.height }

        // Layout the children
        layout(width, height) {
            placeables.forEach { placeable ->
                placeable.placeRelative(0, 0) // Overlap both texts
            }
        }
    }
}

@Composable
fun CustomLayoutExample() {
    OverlappingTextLayout(
        text1 = "Hello",
        text2 = "World",
        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
    )
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Content**:
   - The `OverlappingTextLayout` accepts two texts as input and uses the `Layout` composable to define custom behavior.
2. **Measurement**:
   - Each child is measured using the provided constraints.
3. **Placement**:
   - Both texts are placed at the same position `(0, 0)` to overlap.

---

## Best Practices
- Use custom layouts only when built-in layouts like `Row`, `Column`, or `Box` cannot achieve the desired behavior.
- Keep measurement and placement logic simple and efficient.
- Use `Modifier` to add flexibility and reusability to your custom layout.

## Summary
Creating custom layouts in Jetpack Compose allows you to define unique measurement and positioning logic for composables. By using the `Layout` composable, you can design layouts tailored to your app's specific requirements.
