# Difference Between `remember` and `rememberSaveable`

Both `remember` and `rememberSaveable` are used to manage state in Jetpack Compose, but they serve different purposes.

## `remember`
- Retains state across recompositions.
- Does **not** survive configuration changes (e.g., screen rotations).
- Use it for transient state that doesn't need to persist.

### Example:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun RememberExample() {
    var counter by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    // ...existing code...
}
```
- The `counter` value resets to `0` after a configuration change.

---

## `rememberSaveable`
- Retains state across recompositions **and** survives configuration changes.
- Uses `SavedStateHandle` or `Bundle` under the hood to persist state.

### Example:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun RememberSaveableExample() {
    var counter by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(0) }
    // ...existing code...
}
```
- The `counter` value persists even after a configuration change.

## Key Differences

| Feature                  | `remember`                  | `rememberSaveable`           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Survives recomposition** | Yes                         | Yes                          |
| **Survives configuration changes** | No                          | Yes                          |
| **Use case**             | Transient state             | Persistent state             |

---

## When to Use
- Use `remember` for temporary state that doesn't need to survive configuration changes (e.g., animations, UI-only state).
- Use `rememberSaveable` for state that should persist across configuration changes (e.g., form inputs, counters).

---

## Summary
- `remember` is lightweight and suitable for transient state.
- `rememberSaveable` is more robust and should be used when state persistence is required.
