# Phases in Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose operates in three main phases to render and update the UI efficiently. These phases ensure that the UI is built, measured, and drawn correctly.

## The Three Phases

1. **Composition Phase**:
   - This is where the UI tree is created.
   - Composable functions are executed to describe the UI.
   - The result is a tree of UI elements.

2. **Layout Phase**:
   - In this phase, the size and position of each composable are determined.
   - Compose measures each composable based on its constraints and assigns it a position.

3. **Drawing Phase**:
   - The final phase where the UI is drawn on the screen.
   - Compose renders the visual representation of the UI elements.

## Example of the Phases
```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhasesExample() {
    Box(
        modifier = Modifier
            .size(100.dp)
            .background(Color.Red)
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Hello, Phases!",
            modifier = Modifier
                .align(Alignment.Center)
                .background(Color.White)
        )
    }
}
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Composition**:
   - The `Box` and `Text` composables are executed to describe the UI structure.
2. **Layout**:
   - The `Box` is measured to be 100x100 dp.
   - The `Text` is measured and positioned at the center of the `Box`.
3. **Drawing**:
   - The `Box` is drawn with a red background.
   - The `Text` is drawn with a white background and the text "Hello, Phases!".

## Key Points
- Compose optimizes these phases to minimize unnecessary recompositions and redraws.
- Only the parts of the UI affected by state changes go through these phases again.

## Best Practices
- Keep composables small and focused to reduce the cost of recomposition.
- Use `Modifier` effectively to control layout and drawing behavior.
- Avoid unnecessary recompositions by managing state properly.

## Summary
Understanding the phases in Jetpack Compose helps in building efficient and performant UIs. By leveraging these phases, Compose ensures that only the necessary parts of the UI are updated and redrawn.
