# Can We Use Both Jetpack Compose and Android View in a Single App?

Yes, Jetpack Compose and Android Views can coexist in a single app. This interoperability allows developers to gradually migrate to Compose or reuse existing Views alongside Compose.

## Use Cases
1. **Gradual Migration**:
   - Migrate parts of an app to Compose while keeping the rest in the View system.
2. **Reusing Existing Views**:
   - Reuse custom Views or third-party libraries that are built on the View system.
3. **Complex Scenarios**:
   - Use Compose for new screens and Views for legacy or highly customized components.

## How to Use Both in a Single App

### 1. Embedding Compose in Android Views
- Use `ComposeView` to embed a composable inside a traditional View-based layout.

#### Example:
```xml
<!-- XML Layout -->
<androidx.compose.ui.platform.ComposeView
    android:id="@+id/composeView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

```kotlin
// In Activity or Fragment
val composeView: ComposeView = findViewById(R.id.composeView)
composeView.setContent {
    Text("Hello from Compose!")
}
```

### 2. Embedding Android Views in Compose
- Use `AndroidView` to embed a traditional View inside a composable.

#### Example:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun AndroidViewExample() {
    AndroidView(
        factory = { context ->
            TextView(context).apply {
                text = "Hello from Android View!"
            }
        },
        update = { textView ->
            textView.text = "Updated Text"
        }
    )
}
```

## Best Practices
- **Gradual Migration**:
  - Start with Compose for new screens or features while keeping existing Views intact.
- **Reuse Existing Components**:
  - Use `AndroidView` to integrate custom Views or third-party libraries.
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Minimize the number of transitions between Compose and Views to avoid performance overhead.

## Summary
Jetpack Compose and Android Views can coexist seamlessly, enabling developers to leverage the strengths of both systems. By using `ComposeView` and `AndroidView`, you can integrate Compose into existing apps or reuse Views in Compose-based projects.
