# Explain `derivedStateOf` in Jetpack Compose

`derivedStateOf` is a Jetpack Compose API used to create a state that depends on other states. It optimizes recompositions by recalculating the derived state only when its dependencies change.

## Purpose of `derivedStateOf`
- To avoid unnecessary recompositions by recalculating derived values only when the dependent state changes.
- To improve performance in scenarios where derived values are expensive to compute.

## How It Works
- `derivedStateOf` wraps a computation that depends on one or more states.
- The computation is only re-executed when the dependent state changes.

## Use Cases
1. **Expensive Computations**:
   - Use `derivedStateOf` to optimize recompositions for derived values that are costly to compute.
2. **Filtering or Transforming Data**:
   - Use it to create filtered or transformed versions of a state.
3. **Avoiding Redundant Recomputations**:
   - Use it to ensure recompositions are triggered only when necessary.

## Example
```kotlin
@Composable
fun DerivedStateOfExample() {
    var inputText by remember { mutableStateOf("") }

    // Derived state that calculates the length of the input text
    val textLength by remember {
        derivedStateOf { inputText.length }
    }

    Column {
        TextField(
            value = inputText,
            onValueChange = { inputText = it },
            label = { Text("Enter text") }
        )
        Text("Text length: $textLength")
    }
}
```
- In this example:
  - The `textLength` state is derived from `inputText`.
  - The `Text` composable displaying the length only recomposes when `inputText` changes.

## Key Points
- `derivedStateOf` is useful for optimizing recompositions in scenarios where derived values depend on other states.
- It should be used with `remember` to ensure the derived state is retained across recompositions.

## Best Practices
- Use `derivedStateOf` for derived values that are expensive to compute or when recompositions need to be minimized.
- Avoid overusing it for simple computations, as it adds unnecessary complexity.
- Always wrap `derivedStateOf` inside `remember` to retain its value across recompositions.

## Summary
`derivedStateOf` is a powerful tool in Jetpack Compose for creating optimized, derived states. It ensures that recompositions are efficient and only occur when necessary, making it ideal for performance-critical scenarios.
