# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used for managing shared resources like database connections, network managers, and logging.

## Implementation in Java (Thread-Safe Singleton)
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## Implementation in Kotlin (Thread-Safe Singleton)
```kotlin
object Singleton {
    fun doSomething() {
        println("Singleton instance is working!")
    }
}
```

## Advantages
- Ensures a single instance of the class.
- Reduces memory usage when dealing with global shared resources.
- Provides a global access point to the instance.

## Disadvantages
- Can introduce global state, which may lead to difficulties in testing.
- May cause hidden dependencies in code, making debugging harder.

## Use Cases in Android
- Managing a Retrofit API Client
- Database Connection Management (e.g., Room)
- Centralized Shared Preferences Manager
- Logging System
