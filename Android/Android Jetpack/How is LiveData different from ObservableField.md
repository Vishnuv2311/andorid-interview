# How is LiveData different from ObservableField?

Both LiveData and ObservableField are used for data binding in Android, but they have distinct differences in functionality and use cases.

## 1. LiveData:
- **Lifecycle-aware**: LiveData is aware of the lifecycle of its observers and only updates active observers.
- **Automatic cleanup**: It avoids memory leaks by automatically removing observers when the lifecycle owner is destroyed.
- **Thread-safe**: LiveData can be updated on a background thread, and UI updates will be posted to the main thread.
- **Recommended for MVVM**: LiveData is a key component in Android's Jetpack architecture and is well-suited for ViewModel.

## 2. ObservableField:
- **Not lifecycle-aware**: ObservableField does not respect the lifecycle of its observers and can cause memory leaks if not handled properly.
- **Lighter alternative**: It is part of Android's Data Binding library and is a lightweight alternative to LiveData when lifecycle management is not required.
- **Does not require ViewModel**: Unlike LiveData, ObservableField can be used directly in a data binding layout without a ViewModel.
- **Updates must be manual**: Observers need to be explicitly notified when data changes, as it lacks automatic lifecycle handling.

## When to Use What?
- **Use LiveData** when working with ViewModel and lifecycle-aware components.
- **Use ObservableField** when a simple, lightweight data binding solution is needed without lifecycle management.
