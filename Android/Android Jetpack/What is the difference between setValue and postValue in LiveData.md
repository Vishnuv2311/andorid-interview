# Difference between setValue and postValue in LiveData

In Android's LiveData, both `setValue()` and `postValue()` are used to update the stored data, but they have different execution behaviors.

## `setValue()`
- Must be called on the **main thread (UI thread)**.
- Updates the value **synchronously**.
- If called multiple times before observers are notified, only the last value is dispatched.

## `postValue()`
- Can be called from **any thread**, including background threads.
- Updates the value **asynchronously**.
- If called multiple times in quick succession, only the last value is posted and delivered to observers.

## When to Use Which?
- Use `setValue()` when updating LiveData from the main thread.
- Use `postValue()` when updating LiveData from a background thread to avoid UI thread violations.

## Example:
```kotlin
val liveData = MutableLiveData<String>()

fun updateFromMainThread() {
    liveData.setValue("Updated on main thread") // Works only on UI thread
}

fun updateFromBackgroundThread() {
    Thread {
        liveData.postValue("Updated from background thread") // Safe to call from any thread
    }.start()
}
```

## Key Takeaway
- `setValue()` is synchronous and only for the main thread.
- `postValue()` is asynchronous and can be used from any thread.
