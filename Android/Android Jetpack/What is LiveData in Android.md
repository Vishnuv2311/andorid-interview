# What is LiveData in Android?

LiveData is an observable data holder class that is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of Android components such as Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels. 

## Key Features:
- **Lifecycle-aware**: LiveData only updates active observers (i.e., those in the STARTED or RESUMED state).
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Observers are removed when their lifecycle is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.
- **Ensures UI Consistency**: UI components always receive the latest data when they become active.
- **No Manual Lifecycle Handling**: It automatically stops observing when the lifecycle owner is destroyed.

## Usage:
```kotlin
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val _data = MutableLiveData&lt;String&gt;()
    val data: LiveData&lt;String&gt; get() = _data

    fun updateData(newValue: String) {
        _data.value = newValue
    }
}
```

In an Activity or Fragment:
```kotlin
myViewModel.data.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { updatedData ->
    textView.text = updatedData
}
```

## Types of LiveData:
- **MutableLiveData**: Allows updating the data using `setValue()` or `postValue()`.
- **LiveData**: Read-only, preventing direct modification.

## When to Use LiveData?
- To keep UI components updated with changing data.
- To prevent memory leaks caused by stale references.
- When data changes should be automatically reflected in the UI.

LiveData is a fundamental part of Android Jetpack, simplifying data handling in UI components.
