# What is the Project Structure of an Android Application?

An Android project consists of several key directories and files that help in building the application efficiently. Below is the standard structure of an Android project:

## 1. **Manifests**
   - Contains the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, which defines essential application metadata like permissions, activities, services, and broadcast receivers.

## 2. **Java/Kotlin**
   - Includes the source code of the application.
   - Organized into packages, typically starting with the appâ€™s package name.
   - Includes `ViewModels`, `Repositories`, `Adapters`, `Activities`, and `Fragments`.

## 3. **res (Resources)**
   - Stores non-code resources like images, XML layouts, and strings.
   - Important subdirectories:
     - `drawable/` - Stores images and vector assets.
     - `layout/` - Contains XML files defining UI components.
     - `mipmap/` - Holds app launcher icons in different resolutions.
     - `values/` - Stores XML files for colors, dimensions, styles, and string resources.

## 4. **Gradle Scripts**
   - `build.gradle (Project Level)` - Defines global project configurations.
   - `build.gradle (Module Level)` - Contains dependencies, SDK versions, and plugin settings.
   - `gradle.properties` - Configures Gradle properties.
   - `settings.gradle` - Lists included modules.
   - `local.properties` - Stores local machine-specific configurations (e.g., SDK location).

## 5. **Assets**
   - Used for storing raw files like JSON, fonts, and databases.

## 6. **libs**
   - Stores external libraries in `.jar` or `.aar` formats.

## 7. **Tests**
   - `androidTest/` - Contains UI and instrumentation tests.
   - `test/` - Includes unit tests that run on the JVM.

## 8. **Build/Outputs**
   - Generated files like APKs, decompiled resources, and intermediate files.

Understanding this structure helps in better organizing and managing an Android project.
