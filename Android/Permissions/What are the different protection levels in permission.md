# Different Protection Levels in Android Permissions

Android defines four protection levels for permissions to control access to system features and data:

1. **Normal**:  
   - These permissions grant access to data and actions that pose minimal risk to the user.
   - The system automatically grants these permissions without user approval.
   - Example: `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`.

2. **Dangerous**:  
   - These permissions grant access to sensitive user data or features that could affect user privacy.
   - The user must explicitly grant these permissions at runtime.
   - Example: `READ_CONTACTS`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`.

3. **Signature**:  
   - These permissions are only granted if the requesting app is signed with the same certificate as the app declaring the permission.
   - This is useful for inter-process communication between apps from the same developer.
   - Example: Custom permissions declared by apps.

4. **SignatureOrSystem** (Deprecated):  
   - Previously allowed permissions if the requesting app was signed with the same certificate as the system or installed in the system image.
   - Deprecated in modern Android versions for security reasons.

**Usage Example in Manifest:**
```xml
&lt;permission android:name="com.example.myapp.MY_PERMISSION"
    android:protectionLevel="signature" /&gt;
```

Understanding these protection levels is crucial for developing secure Android applications.
