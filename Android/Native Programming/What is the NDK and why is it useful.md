# What is the NDK and Why is it Useful?

The **Android Native Development Kit (NDK)** is a set of tools that allows developers to use C and C++ code in Android applications. It enables direct interaction with native system components and hardware, improving performance for computationally intensive tasks.

## Why is the NDK Useful?
- **Performance Optimization**: NDK helps in optimizing performance-critical parts of an application, such as real-time audio processing, physics simulations, and complex calculations.
- **Reuse of Existing Code**: Developers can leverage existing C/C++ libraries without rewriting them in Java or Kotlin.
- **Low-Level Access**: It allows direct interaction with system components and hardware acceleration features like OpenGL for graphics-intensive applications.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Code written in C/C++ can be reused across different platforms, reducing development effort.

## When to Use the NDK?
- When performance is critical and Java/Kotlin is not efficient enough.
- When integrating with legacy C/C++ codebases.
- For applications that require heavy processing, such as video processing, machine learning, or gaming.

However, using the NDK introduces additional complexity, so it should be used only when necessary.
