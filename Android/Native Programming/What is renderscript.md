# What is RenderScript?

RenderScript is a framework for high-performance computation in Android, designed for tasks that can be efficiently parallelized. It is primarily used for image processing, computational photography, and general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) operations.

## Features:
- Supports heterogeneous computing across CPU, GPU, and DSP.
- Optimized for parallel execution.
- Used in applications requiring heavy computational workloads like filters in the Android default camera app.

## Deprecation:
As of Android 12, RenderScript has been deprecated in favor of Vulkan and GPU Compute APIs like OpenGL and OpenCL for advanced processing tasks.

## Alternatives:
- OpenGL ES / Vulkan for GPU-based computations.
- The Neural Networks API (NNAPI) for machine learning workloads.
- Traditional multi-threading techniques for CPU-based parallelism.
