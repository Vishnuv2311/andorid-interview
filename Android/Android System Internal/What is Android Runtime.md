# Android Runtime (ART)

Android Runtime (ART) is the managed runtime used by Android applications. It was introduced in Android 4.4 (KitKat) as an experimental runtime and became the default runtime in Android 5.0 (Lollipop), replacing the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM).

## Features of Android Runtime:
- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Unlike Dalvik, which used Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, ART compiles applications into native machine code at the time of installation, leading to improved performance.
- **Improved Garbage Collection (GC)**: ART features a more efficient garbage collector that reduces application pauses, improving responsiveness.
- **Better Debugging Support**: ART provides improved debugging and profiling tools, such as detailed crash reports and better diagnostic capabilities.
- **Reduced Power Consumption**: Due to optimized execution, ART helps reduce CPU usage, leading to better battery performance.
- **Improved Memory Management**: ART optimizes memory usage, reducing memory footprint and enhancing multitasking efficiency.

## Differences Between ART and Dalvik:
| Feature  | Dalvik | ART |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Compilation | Just-In-Time (JIT) | Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) |
| Performance | Slower, as bytecode is interpreted | Faster, as precompiled machine code is used |
| Garbage Collection | Frequent pauses due to GC events | Optimized GC with reduced pause times |
| Debugging | Limited debugging features | Better profiling and debugging tools |

ART has significantly improved the overall performance and efficiency of Android applications, making it an essential component of modern Android systems.
