# Differences Between Dalvik and ART

Android applications run on a runtime environment, and over the years, Android has transitioned from Dalvik to ART (Android Runtime). Below are the key differences between the two:

## 1. Compilation Approach
- **Dalvik**: Uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles code at runtime.
- **ART**: Uses Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation, which compiles the code at the time of installation.

## 2. Performance
- **Dalvik**: Slower execution due to JIT compiling code during execution.
- **ART**: Faster execution since code is precompiled.

## 3. Memory Usage
- **Dalvik**: Consumes less storage space initially but has a higher CPU overhead due to JIT compilation.
- **ART**: Uses more storage as apps are precompiled, but reduces CPU overhead.

## 4. Battery Consumption
- **Dalvik**: Higher battery consumption because of repeated JIT compilations.
- **ART**: More efficient as it reduces CPU usage.

## 5. Garbage Collection
- **Dalvik**: Uses a stop-the-world garbage collector that can pause execution.
- **ART**: Uses a more efficient garbage collector, reducing pauses.

## 6. Application Installation
- **Dalvik**: Faster installation since compilation happens during execution.
- **ART**: Slower installation due to AOT compilation.

## 7. Debugging and Development
- **Dalvik**: Easier for developers to debug because changes are applied at runtime.
- **ART**: Requires a full recompilation after changes, making debugging slower.

## Conclusion
ART provides better performance, lower CPU overhead, and improved battery efficiency compared to Dalvik. Since Android 5.0 (Lollipop), ART has completely replaced Dalvik as the default runtime.
