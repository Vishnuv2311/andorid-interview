# What is DEX?

DEX (Dalvik Executable) is a file format used by Android applications to store compiled code. It is optimized for the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) and later for the Android Runtime (ART). 

## Key Features:
- **Optimized for Mobile Devices**: DEX files are designed to be lightweight and efficient for execution on limited-resource devices.
- **Single or Multiple DEX Files**: Apps may contain a single DEX file (`classes.dex`) or multiple (`classes2.dex`, etc.) if they exceed the 64K method limit.
- **Converted from Java Bytecode**: Android compiles Java `.class` files into `.dex` format using the `dx` tool (for older versions) or `D8` (for newer versions).

## How It Works:
1. The Android build process compiles Java source code into `.class` files.
2. These `.class` files are then converted into a `.dex` file.
3. The `.dex` file is packaged into an APK along with other resources.
4. During installation, ART or Dalvik further optimizes the DEX bytecode for execution.

## Why is DEX Important?
- **Performance**: DEX is optimized for faster execution on Android devices.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Designed to minimize memory usage and improve battery life.
- **Support for Multidexing**: Allows large applications to bypass the 64K method reference limit.
