# Can You Manually Call the Garbage Collector in Android?

In Android, you can request garbage collection manually using:

```kotlin
System.gc()
Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
```

However, calling the garbage collector manually does not guarantee immediate collection. The Android Runtime (ART) and Dalvik decide the optimal time to run garbage collection to minimize performance impact.

## Why You Should Avoid Manually Calling GC
- **Performance Overhead**: Frequent calls to `gc()` can lead to performance issues due to unnecessary CPU usage.
- **Inefficiency**: The system already optimizes garbage collection, and forcing it manually can be counterproductive.
- **Pauses Execution**: Manual GC calls may introduce UI lag or frame drops in performance-critical applications.

## Best Practices
- Use memory-efficient coding practices to reduce GC pressure.
- Utilize tools like `Android Profiler` to detect memory leaks.
- Use `WeakReference` or `SoftReference` for objects that can be garbage collected when needed.
- Implement proper lifecycle management to release resources when not in use.
