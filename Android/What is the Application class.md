# What is the Application Class in Android?

The `Application` class in Android is a base class for maintaining global application state. It is instantiated before any other class when the process for the application is created.

## Key Features:
- **Lifecycle:** It lives throughout the entire lifecycle of the application.
- **Global State Management:** Used to maintain and share global state across activities and services.
- **Dependency Injection:** Often used to set up dependency injection frameworks like Dagger or Hilt.
- **Configuration:** Can be used to configure analytics, logging, or global settings.
- **Singleton Instance:** Acts as a singleton instance that can be accessed across different components.

## How to Use `Application` Class?
To use the `Application` class, you need to extend it and specify it in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

### Example:
```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        // Initialize libraries or global configurations here
    }
}
```

### Register in Manifest:
```xml
<application
    android:name=".MyApplication"
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme">
</application>
```

## When to Use?
- When you need to maintain global state across different components.
- When initializing libraries at the start of the application lifecycle.
- When setting up dependency injection frameworks.

## Important Considerations:
- The `Application` class should be lightweight to avoid performance issues.
- Avoid storing large data objects to prevent memory leaks.
- Use it only when necessary to avoid increasing app startup time.
