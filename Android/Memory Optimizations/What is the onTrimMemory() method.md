# What is the onTrimMemory() Method?

The `onTrimMemory()` method is a callback introduced in Android API level 14 that notifies an application when the system is running low on memory. This allows the application to release unused resources to improve overall system performance.

## Usage

The method is part of the `ComponentCallbacks2` interface and can be overridden in `Activity`, `Fragment`, or `Application` classes:

```kotlin
override fun onTrimMemory(level: Int) {
    super.onTrimMemory(level)
    when (level) {
        ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN -> {
            // Release resources related to UI as the app is no longer visible
        }
        ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW,
        ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL -> {
            // Free up resources as the system is running low on memory
        }
        ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND,
        ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE,
        ComponentCallbacks2.TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE -> {
            // App is in the background; release as many resources as possible
        }
    }
}
```

## Trim Levels

The `level` parameter provides information about the system's memory state:

- `TRIM_MEMORY_UI_HIDDEN`: The app is in the background.
- `TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_LOW`: The system is running low on memory.
- `TRIM_MEMORY_RUNNING_CRITICAL`: The system is critically low on memory.
- `TRIM_MEMORY_BACKGROUND`: The app is in the background, and memory is needed elsewhere.
- `TRIM_MEMORY_MODERATE`: The app is in the background and should release memory.
- `TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE`: The app is at the lowest priority and should release as much memory as possible.

## Best Practices

- Release caches, large bitmaps, and other non-essential resources.
- Reduce memory usage in background processes.
- Use `onTrimMemory()` along with `onLowMemory()` for effective memory management.
