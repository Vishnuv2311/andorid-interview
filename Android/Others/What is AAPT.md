 **AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool)** is a command-line tool that Android uses to compile and package application resources. It processes resources like XML files, images, and other assets, generating the necessary binary format files for Android applications.
 
 ## Key Functions of AAPT:
 - Converts XML resource files into a binary format used by Android.
 - Generates the `R.java` file, which contains references to all resources.
 - Packages resources into the final APK file.
 - Provides commands to inspect, list, and extract content from APK files.
 
 ## Common AAPT Commands:
 - `aapt dump badging your_app.apk` – Displays information about the APK.
 - `aapt list your_app.apk` – Lists files inside the APK.
 - `aapt crunch` – Optimizes PNG images for better performance.
 
 AAPT is an essential tool for Android developers to manage application resources efficiently.
