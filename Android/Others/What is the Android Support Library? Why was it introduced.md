# What is the Android Support Library? Why was it introduced?

The Android Support Library was introduced by Google to provide backward compatibility to older Android versions and allow developers to use the latest features without needing to target only the newest Android versions.

## Why was it introduced?
- **Backward Compatibility**: Allows new features to be used on older Android versions.
- **Frequent Updates**: Provides regular updates independent of the Android OS release cycle.
- **Modularization**: Components were broken into smaller, more manageable libraries.
- **Extended Functionality**: Includes additional UI components, utilities, and support classes.

Over time, the Android Support Library evolved into AndroidX, which is now the recommended library set for modern Android development.
