# FlatBuffers vs JSON

## FlatBuffers
- Developed by Google, FlatBuffers is a high-performance, cross-platform serialization library.
- It allows for efficient parsing without requiring deserialization.
- Provides direct memory access to serialized data, leading to lower memory overhead and faster processing.
- Well-suited for performance-critical applications like game development and real-time systems.

## JSON
- A widely used, human-readable text format for data interchange.
- Requires parsing and object creation, which can introduce performance overhead.
- Easier to work with due to its readability and support in almost all programming languages.
- Suitable for web applications, APIs, and general data exchange.

## Comparison

| Feature         | FlatBuffers      | JSON             |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Parsing Speed  | Faster (zero-copy) | Slower (requires parsing) |
| Memory Usage   | Lower (no extra object creation) | Higher (creates objects) |
| Human Readability | No (binary format) | Yes (text-based) |
| Schema Enforcement | Yes (strict schema) | No (flexible) |
| Use Case       | Real-time, gaming, embedded systems | Web, API communication |

## When to Use What?
- Use **FlatBuffers** when performance is critical and memory efficiency is needed.
- Use **JSON** when readability, flexibility, and ease of use are more important.
