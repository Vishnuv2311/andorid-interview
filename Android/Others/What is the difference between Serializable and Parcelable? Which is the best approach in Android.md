# Difference Between Serializable and Parcelable in Android

## Serializable
- Serializable is a standard Java interface.
- It uses reflection to serialize and deserialize objects.
- It is simple to implement but has significant performance overhead.
- Slower in Android due to the use of reflection and additional object creation.

## Parcelable
- Parcelable is an Android-specific interface.
- It is much faster as it is optimized for Android IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
- Requires manual implementation, making it more complex than Serializable.
- Ideal for passing data between activities and fragments.

## Best Approach
- **Parcelable** is the best approach for Android development due to its high performance and efficiency.
- Serializable should be avoided in performance-sensitive applications.

## Example

**Serializable Implementation**
```java
public class User implements Serializable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

**Parcelable Implementation**
```java
public class User implements Parcelable {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public User(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    protected User(Parcel in) {
        name = in.readString();
        age = in.readInt();
    }

    public static final Creator<User> CREATOR = new Creator<User>() {
        @Override
        public User createFromParcel(Parcel in) {
            return new User(in);
        }

        @Override
        public User[] newArray(int size) {
            return new User[size];
        }
    };

    @Override
    public int describeContents() {
        return 0;
    }

    @Override
    public void writeToParcel(Parcel dest, int flags) {
        dest.writeString(name);
        dest.writeInt(age);
    }
}
```
