# Can We Identify the Users Who Have Uninstalled Our Application?

## Direct Identification

- **No, you cannot directly identify users who have uninstalled your application.**
- Android does not provide any API or callback to notify your app or server when a user uninstalls the app.
- Once the app is uninstalled, it cannot execute any code or send any signals.

## Indirect Approaches

- **Push Notification Tokens**: If you use push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging), you can infer uninstalls indirectly:
  - When you send a push notification and receive an "unregistered" or "invalid token" response, it may indicate the app was uninstalled on that device.
- **Server Heartbeats**: Some apps periodically send "heartbeat" signals to a server. If a user stops sending heartbeats for a long time, it might indicate uninstallation, but this is not definitive.

## Privacy and Policy

- Android's design intentionally prevents apps from tracking uninstalls to protect user privacy.
- Attempting to track uninstalls beyond the allowed mechanisms may violate Google Play policies.

## Summary

- You cannot directly detect or identify users who have uninstalled your app.
- Indirect methods (like monitoring push notification delivery failures) can give hints, but are not 100% reliable.
