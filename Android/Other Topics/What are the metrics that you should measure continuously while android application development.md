# What Are the Metrics That You Should Measure Continuously While Android Application Development?

Measuring key metrics throughout Android app development helps ensure quality, performance, and user satisfaction.

## Important Metrics to Monitor

1. **App Startup Time**
   - Measures how long the app takes to launch.
   - Fast startup improves user experience.

2. **UI Rendering Performance (FPS, Jank)**
   - Monitors frame rates and dropped frames.
   - Ensures smooth animations and interactions.

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Tracks RAM consumption and memory leaks.
   - Prevents OutOfMemory errors and improves stability.

4. **CPU Usage**
   - Monitors CPU load during app operations.
   - Helps identify inefficient code or background tasks.

5. **Battery Consumption**
   - Measures how much battery the app uses.
   - Optimizes background work and resource usage.

6. **Network Usage**
   - Tracks data sent and received.
   - Helps optimize network calls and reduce data costs.

7. **Crash Rate & ANRs (Application Not Responding)**
   - Monitors app crashes and ANR events.
   - Critical for app stability and user trust.

8. **App Size**
   - Measures APK or AAB size.
   - Smaller apps are faster to download and install.

9. **User Engagement Metrics**
   - Tracks active users, session length, retention, and churn.
   - Helps understand user behavior and app usage patterns.

10. **Error Rates & Exceptions**
    - Monitors handled and unhandled exceptions.
    - Helps catch bugs before they affect many users.

11. **Accessibility Metrics**
    - Ensures the app is usable by people with disabilities.
    - Includes content descriptions, touch target sizes, etc.

12. **Security Metrics**
    - Monitors for vulnerabilities and data leaks.
    - Ensures user data is protected.

## Tools for Monitoring Metrics

- **Android Studio Profiler**: For CPU, memory, and network profiling.
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: For crash and error reporting.
- **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: For startup time, network, and rendering metrics.
- **Google Analytics / Firebase Analytics**: For user engagement and retention.
- **LeakCanary**: For memory leak detection.

## Summary

Continuously monitoring these metrics helps maintain a high-quality, performant, and user-friendly Android application.
