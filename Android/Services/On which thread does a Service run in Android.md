## On which thread does a Service run in Android?

By default, a Service in Android runs on the main (UI) thread of the application. This means that if a long-running operation is performed inside a Service, it can block the UI thread and cause the app to become unresponsive.

To perform background operations within a Service, you should use a separate worker thread. Some common approaches include:

- **Using a separate Thread or HandlerThread**: Manually create and manage a background thread within the Service.
- **Using IntentService (deprecated)**: A subclass of Service that automatically runs tasks in a background thread.
- **Using Kotlin Coroutines or WorkManager**: Modern and recommended ways to handle background tasks efficiently.

If a Service needs to perform CPU-intensive or network-related tasks, it's crucial to offload work to background threads to ensure smooth performance.
