# What is a Component in Dagger?

In Dagger, a **Component** is an interface that acts as a bridge between **Modules** (which provide dependencies) and the places where those dependencies are required. It is responsible for injecting dependencies into fields, constructors, or methods.

## Key Responsibilities:
- Specifies the dependency graph.
- Connects the **@Module** (which provides dependencies) with the **@Inject** (which requests dependencies).
- Generates code at compile-time to resolve dependencies.

## Example:

```kotlin
@Component(modules = [NetworkModule::class])
interface AppComponent {
    fun inject(activity: MainActivity)
}
```

Here, `AppComponent` takes dependencies from `NetworkModule` and provides them to `MainActivity`.

## Scope Management:
- Components can define **scopes** (e.g., `@Singleton`) to manage the lifecycle of dependencies.

## Subcomponents:
- For better modularity, **Subcomponents** can extend existing components to provide additional dependencies.

## Conclusion:
Dagger Components simplify dependency injection by automatically providing required instances, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.
