# When to use defer operator in RxJava

The `defer` operator in RxJava is used when you want to create a fresh Observable instance for each new Observer. This is particularly useful when the data source or computation should be evaluated at the time of subscription rather than at the time of Observable creation.

## Use Cases
1. **Lazy Initialization**: When you want to defer the creation of an Observable until an Observer subscribes.
2. **Fetching Fresh Data**: Ensures that each subscriber gets the most up-to-date data.
3. **Dynamic Data Sources**: Useful when the Observable depends on variables that may change over time.
4. **Avoiding Premature Execution**: Prevents immediate execution of expensive computations.

## Example

```kotlin
val observable = Observable.defer {
    Observable.just(System.currentTimeMillis())
}

observable.subscribe { println("First Subscription: $it") }
Thread.sleep(1000)
observable.subscribe { println("Second Subscription: $it") }
```

### Explanation:
- Here, `defer` ensures that `System.currentTimeMillis()` is called at subscription time.
- Each subscription gets a fresh timestamp instead of reusing the same value.

## Difference Between `defer` and `just`
- `Observable.just(value)`: Captures the value immediately when created.
- `Observable.defer { Observable.just(value) }`: Captures the value when subscribed.

## When **Not** to Use `defer`
- If you don't need fresh data for each subscription.
- If the computation is not expensive and can be cached.
