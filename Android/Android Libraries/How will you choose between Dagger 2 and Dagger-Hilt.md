# How will you choose between Dagger 2 and Dagger-Hilt

## Introduction
Dagger is a popular dependency injection framework for Java and Android. Dagger 2 and Dagger-Hilt are two versions of this framework, each with its unique features and use cases. In this document, we will compare Dagger 2 and Dagger-Hilt based on various factors to help you determine which one is best suited for your project.

## Complexity
Dagger 2 is known for its flexibility but can be complex to set up and manage, especially for larger projects. It requires a deep understanding of annotations and component lifecycles, which can lead to a steep learning curve for new developers. On the other hand, Dagger-Hilt simplifies the setup process significantly by providing a set of predefined components and reducing the need for boilerplate code. This makes it easier for developers to implement dependency injection in their Android applications.

## Boilerplate Code
One of the main criticisms of Dagger 2 is the amount of boilerplate code it requires. Developers often need to create multiple modules and components to manage dependencies effectively. In contrast, Dagger-Hilt minimizes boilerplate by using a more streamlined approach. It automatically generates the necessary components and simplifies the dependency injection process, allowing developers to focus more on the application logic rather than the configuration.

## Ease of Setup
Setting up Dagger 2 can be time-consuming, especially for beginners. It requires configuring various components and understanding the lifecycle of dependencies. Dagger-Hilt, however, is designed specifically for Android and provides a more straightforward setup process. With just a few annotations, developers can get started with dependency injection, making it an attractive option for new projects or developers who want to save time.

## Recommended Use Cases
Dagger 2 is recommended for projects that require fine-grained control over dependency injection and where the developer has a strong understanding of the framework. It is suitable for complex applications where custom components and scopes are necessary. Dagger-Hilt, on the other hand, is ideal for standard Android applications that benefit from a simplified setup and reduced boilerplate. It is particularly useful for new projects or when working with teams that may not have extensive experience with dependency injection.

## AndroidX Integration
Dagger-Hilt is built on top of Dagger 2 and is fully integrated with AndroidX libraries. This integration allows developers to take advantage of modern Android features, such as ViewModel and LiveData, without the additional complexity of managing dependencies manually. Dagger 2 can also be integrated with AndroidX, but it may require more configuration and setup.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the choice between Dagger 2 and Dagger-Hilt largely depends on the specific needs of your project. If you require fine-tuned control and have the expertise to manage the complexity, Dagger 2 may be the better option. However, for most Android applications, especially those that prioritize ease of use and quick setup, Dagger-Hilt is the recommended choice. By considering the factors of complexity, boilerplate code, ease of setup, recommended use cases, and AndroidX integration, you can make an informed decision that aligns with your project requirements.
