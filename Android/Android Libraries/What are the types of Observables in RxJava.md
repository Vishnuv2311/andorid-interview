# Types of Observables in RxJava

In RxJava, Observables are the core components that emit items to their subscribers. Different types of Observables exist to handle various scenarios:

1. **Observable**: The standard Observable that can emit multiple items over time. It follows the Observer pattern and supports multiple subscribers.
   ```java
   Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   ```

2. **Flowable**: Used when dealing with a large number of emissions that might cause backpressure issues. It supports backpressure strategies.
   ```java
   Flowable<Integer> flowable = Flowable.range(1, 1000);
   ```

3. **Single**: Emits only a single item or an error. Ideal for network calls or database queries that return a single result.
   ```java
   Single<String> single = Single.just("RxJava Single");
   ```

4. **Maybe**: Emits either a single item, completes without emitting, or emits an error.
   ```java
   Maybe<Integer> maybe = Maybe.just(100);
   ```

5. **Completable**: Does not emit any item but only signals completion or an error. Useful for actions like writing to a database.
   ```java
   Completable completable = Completable.fromAction(() -> {
       System.out.println("Completed task");
   });
   ```

Each of these Observables serves different purposes and should be used based on the nature of the operation being performed.
