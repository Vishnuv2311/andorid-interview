# Query Optimization in SQLite for Better Performance

Optimizing queries in SQLite is crucial for improving the performance of Android applications. Below are some best practices to achieve better query efficiency:

## 1. Use Indexing
- Index columns that are frequently used in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `JOIN` conditions.
- Avoid over-indexing as it increases write overhead.

## 2. Avoid `SELECT *`
- Fetch only the required columns instead of using `SELECT *` to reduce memory and processing time.

## 3. Use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`
- Analyze how SQLite executes a query and identify bottlenecks.

## 4. Use Parameterized Queries
- Avoid string concatenation to prevent SQL injection and improve performance.

## 5. Normalize Database Schema
- Use proper table structures to minimize redundancy and improve efficiency.

## 6. Optimize Joins
- Prefer using `INNER JOIN` over `OUTER JOIN` where possible.
- Ensure joined columns are indexed for faster retrieval.

## 7. Batch Insert and Update Operations
- Use transactions to batch multiple `INSERT` or `UPDATE` queries to improve performance.

## 8. Use `PRAGMA` Commands
- Enable `PRAGMA synchronous = OFF` for faster writes.
- Use `PRAGMA cache_size` to control the memory used by SQLite.

## 9. Avoid Unnecessary Computations in Queries
- Compute values in the application code if possible rather than in SQL queries.

## 10. Use WAL Mode
- Enable Write-Ahead Logging (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`) to improve concurrent read/write operations.

By following these optimizations, SQLite queries in Android applications can run efficiently, reducing lag and improving overall app performance.
