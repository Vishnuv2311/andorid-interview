# Designing a File Downloader Library

## Introduction
A File Downloader Library is responsible for efficiently downloading files from a remote server while handling network failures, retries, and caching mechanisms. The design must ensure robustness, scalability, and ease of integration.

## Core Components
1. **Download Manager** - Controls and coordinates file downloads.
2. **Network Client** - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
3. **Cache Manager** - Stores downloaded files and manages partial downloads.
4. **Thread Manager** - Manages concurrent downloads efficiently.
5. **Event Listener** - Notifies progress, completion, or errors.

## Features
- Support for resumable downloads.
- Concurrent and parallel downloading.
- Retry mechanism for failed downloads.
- Caching and storage management.
- Download progress tracking.
- Background execution with WorkManager.

## Implementation Details
### 1. Creating the Downloader
```kotlin
class FileDownloader(private val context: Context) {
    private val okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .connectTimeout(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .readTimeout(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .build()

    fun downloadFile(url: String, destination: File, callback: DownloadCallback) {
        val request = Request.Builder().url(url).build()

        okHttpClient.newCall(request).enqueue(object : Callback {
            override fun onFailure(call: Call, e: IOException) {
                callback.onError(e)
            }

            override fun onResponse(call: Call, response: Response) {
                response.body?.let { body ->
                    val inputStream = body.byteStream()
                    val outputStream = FileOutputStream(destination)
                    inputStream.copyTo(outputStream)
                    outputStream.close()
                    callback.onSuccess(destination)
                } ?: callback.onError(IOException("Empty response body"))
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### 2. Callback Interface
```kotlin
interface DownloadCallback {
    fun onSuccess(file: File)
    fun onError(exception: IOException)
}
```

### 3. Download Manager
```kotlin
class DownloadManager(private val context: Context) {
    private val executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)

    fun enqueueDownload(url: String, destination: File, callback: DownloadCallback) {
        executor.execute {
            FileDownloader(context).downloadFile(url, destination, callback)
        }
    }
}
```

## Optimizations
- **Using WorkManager** for background downloads.
- **Progress tracking** using OkHttp's `ResponseBody` and emitting updates.
- **Resume downloads** by supporting `Range` HTTP headers.

## Conclusion
This design provides a flexible, efficient, and scalable file downloader. It ensures robust error handling, caching, and support for resumable downloads, making it a valuable addition to Android applications.
