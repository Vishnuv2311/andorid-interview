# Designing an Image Loading Library

Designing an efficient image loading library requires considerations such as caching, threading, and performance optimizations. Below are key aspects to consider:

## 1. **Core Components**
### a) ImageLoader
- The entry point for the library, responsible for handling image requests.
- Manages caching, fetching, and displaying images.

### b) Cache System
- **Memory Cache**: Stores frequently used images in RAM.
- **Disk Cache**: Stores images persistently on disk to reduce network calls.

### c) Network Module
- Fetches images from URLs using an HTTP client (e.g., OkHttp or HttpURLConnection).

### d) Threading
- Uses background threads for network and disk operations.
- Provides a main thread handler for UI updates.

### e) Image Decoding & Transformation
- Supports resizing, cropping, and applying transformations like rounding corners.

## 2. **Implementation Details**
### a) API Design
```kotlin
class ImageLoader {
    fun load(url: String)
        .placeholder(R.drawable.placeholder)
        .resize(100, 100)
        .cacheStrategy(CacheStrategy.MEMORY)
        .into(imageView)
}
```
### b) Caching Mechanism
- Use **LruCache** for memory caching.
- Use **DiskLruCache** for persistent caching.

### c) Fetching Strategy
- Load from memory cache first.
- If not found, check disk cache.
- If not available, fetch from network.
- Store the result in cache.

### d) Performance Optimizations
- Use **lazy loading**.
- Implement **request deduplication** to prevent redundant downloads.
- Utilize **preloading** for smoother scrolling in RecyclerView.

### e) Third-Party Libraries
If not implementing from scratch, you can leverage:
- **Glide** (Google-backed, highly optimized)
- **Picasso** (Square-backed, simple API)
- **Coil** (Kotlin-first, lightweight)

## Conclusion
A well-designed image loading library optimizes network usage, caches effectively, and ensures smooth UI performance.
