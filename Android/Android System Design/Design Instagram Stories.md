# Design Instagram Stories

## Overview
Instagram Stories is a feature that allows users to share photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. The system should support multimedia uploads, real-time updates, high availability, and efficient content delivery.

## Features
- **Uploading & Editing**: Users can upload images/videos and apply filters, stickers, and text.
- **Ephemeral Content**: Stories automatically disappear after 24 hours.
- **View Tracking**: Track which users have viewed a story.
- **Privacy Settings**: Users can control who can view their stories.
- **Engagement**: Users can react, reply, and share stories.
- **Ads Integration**: Supports targeted advertisements.

## System Architecture
### 1. **Client Side (Mobile & Web)**
- Capture and edit media.
- Upload content to the backend.
- Fetch and display stories efficiently.

### 2. **Backend Services**
- **Story Service**: Handles story creation, expiration, and retrieval.
- **User Service**: Manages user preferences and privacy settings.
- **View Tracking Service**: Records story views for analytics and engagement.
- **Notification Service**: Sends updates to users about new stories.

### 3. **Database Design**
#### Tables
- `Users (id, name, profile_picture, settings)`
- `Stories (id, user_id, media_url, created_at, expires_at, privacy)`
- `StoryViews (id, story_id, viewer_id, viewed_at)`

#### Database Choices
- **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**: Stores metadata and relationships.
- **NoSQL (Cassandra/DynamoDB)**: Stores ephemeral and high-read content efficiently.
- **Object Storage (S3/GCS)**: Stores media files.

## Media Processing
- **Compression & Optimization**: Use FFmpeg or a similar tool.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Distribute content globally.
- **Streaming**: Adaptive bitrate streaming for video playback.

## Scalability & Performance
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple servers.
- **Caching (Redis/Memcached)**: Store frequently accessed data.
- **Sharding & Replication**: For horizontal scaling of databases.
- **Message Queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**: Handle asynchronous tasks like notifications.

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth2-based authentication.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt user data at rest and in transit.
- **Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**: Prevent spamming and attacks.

## Conclusion
Instagram Stories requires a scalable and efficient system that handles multimedia uploads, fast content delivery, and real-time updates while ensuring privacy and engagement features.
