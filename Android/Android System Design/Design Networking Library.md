# Designing a Networking Library

Designing a networking library for Android involves creating a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for handling network requests. Below are the key components and considerations for building an effective networking library.

## 1. Features
- **Asynchronous Requests**: Supports making network calls asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread.
- **Synchronous Requests**: Allows synchronous execution for use cases requiring immediate responses.
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient reuse of network connections for performance optimization.
- **Caching**: Stores responses to reduce network usage and improve speed.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Retries failed requests with exponential backoff.
- **Interceptors**: Provides hooks to modify requests and responses, useful for logging, authentication, and compression.
- **Support for Multiple Protocols**: Works with HTTP, WebSockets, and gRPC.
- **Streaming Support**: Handles large files and media streaming efficiently.

## 2. Architecture
### 2.1 Components
- **Request Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of network calls.
- **Dispatcher**: Handles threading and request execution.
- **Interceptors**: Modify requests and responses before execution.
- **Cache Manager**: Stores and retrieves cached responses.
- **Parser**: Converts raw responses into usable data objects (e.g., JSON to Kotlin objects).

## 3. Implementation Steps
### 3.1 Defining the API
Create a simple interface for making network calls.
```kotlin
interface NetworkClient {
    fun get(url: String, headers: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()): Response
    fun post(url: String, body: Any, headers: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()): Response
    fun put(url: String, body: Any, headers: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()): Response
    fun delete(url: String, headers: Map<String, String> = emptyMap()): Response
}
```

### 3.2 Implementing Request Handling
```kotlin
class HttpClient : NetworkClient {
    override fun get(url: String, headers: Map<String, String>): Response {
        // Use OkHttp or HttpURLConnection to make a GET request
    }

    override fun post(url: String, body: Any, headers: Map<String, String>): Response {
        // Implement HTTP POST request handling
    }

    override fun put(url: String, body: Any, headers: Map<String, String>): Response {
        // Implement HTTP PUT request handling
    }

    override fun delete(url: String, headers: Map<String, String>): Response {
        // Implement HTTP DELETE request handling
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Adding Interceptors
Interceptors allow modifying requests and responses globally.
```kotlin
class LoggingInterceptor : Interceptor {
    override fun intercept(chain: Interceptor.Chain): Response {
        val request = chain.request()
        println("Request: ${request.url}")
        return chain.proceed(request)
    }
}
```

### 3.4 Implementing Caching
```kotlin
class CacheManager(context: Context) {
    private val cacheDir = File(context.cacheDir, "http_cache")
    private val cache = Cache(cacheDir, 10 * 1024 * 1024) // 10MB cache

    fun getCache(): Cache {
        return cache
    }
}
```

### 3.5 Implementing Thread Management
```kotlin
class NetworkDispatcher {
    private val executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)
    
    fun execute(task: Runnable) {
        executor.execute(task)
    }
}
```

## 4. Optimizations
- **Use Gson/Moshi for JSON parsing**.
- **Leverage OkHttp for handling network requests efficiently**.
- **Support Coroutine-based calls for seamless integration in Kotlin**.

## 5. Summary
This networking library is designed to be modular, scalable, and efficient. It includes support for interceptors, caching, retry mechanisms, and multithreading, ensuring seamless network communication in Android applications.
