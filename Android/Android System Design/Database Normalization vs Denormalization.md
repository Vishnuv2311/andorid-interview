# Database Normalization vs Denormalization

## Database Normalization
**Normalization** is the process of structuring a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between them. 

### Advantages of Normalization:
- **Eliminates redundancy:** Reduces data duplication.
- **Ensures data integrity:** Maintains data consistency across tables.
- **Efficient storage:** Reduces the overall database size.
- **Easy updates:** Changes are made in one place rather than multiple locations.
- **Better scalability:** Helps in handling complex queries efficiently.

### Disadvantages of Normalization:
- **Increased complexity:** Requires more table joins for queries.
- **Performance overhead:** More joins can lead to slower read operations.
- **Difficult reporting:** Aggregating data requires more processing.

## Database Denormalization
**Denormalization** is the process of combining tables to optimize read performance at the cost of some redundancy. This approach is often used in read-heavy applications.

### Advantages of Denormalization:
- **Improved query performance:** Reduces the need for expensive joins.
- **Simplified queries:** Data is stored in a way that makes retrieval easier.
- **Faster reporting:** Optimized for data analysis and reporting tasks.

### Disadvantages of Denormalization:
- **Data redundancy:** Increased storage requirements due to duplicate data.
- **Data inconsistency:** More chances of discrepancies due to redundant data.
- **Difficult updates:** Changes must be applied in multiple places.

## When to Use Normalization vs. Denormalization
- Use **Normalization** when:
  - You need high data integrity and consistency.
  - The database requires frequent updates and inserts.
  - Storage efficiency is a concern.

- Use **Denormalization** when:
  - Read performance is more critical than storage efficiency.
  - Your application requires complex reporting and analytics.
  - You need to optimize for fast retrieval over data consistency.
