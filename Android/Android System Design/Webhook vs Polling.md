# Webhook vs Polling

## Webhook
A **webhook** is a mechanism that allows one system to notify another about events in real-time. Instead of continuously checking for updates, a server sends a notification (HTTP request) to the client whenever an event occurs.

**How it Works:**
- A client registers a webhook URL with the server.
- When an event occurs, the server makes an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.
- The client processes the data immediately.

**Advantages:**
- Real-time updates.
- Efficient as it reduces unnecessary network requests.
- Lower resource consumption.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires a publicly accessible endpoint.
- Can be vulnerable to security risks if not properly secured.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Payment gateways notifying a system of completed transactions.
- GitHub sending event notifications for repository changes.

## Polling
**Polling** is a technique where the client repeatedly sends requests to the server at regular intervals to check for updates.

**Types of Polling:**
1. **Short Polling**: The client makes frequent HTTP requests to check for updates.
2. **Long Polling**: The server holds the request open until new data is available, then responds immediately.

**Advantages:**
- Works even when the client cannot expose a webhook.
- Simple to implement.

**Disadvantages:**
- Inefficient as it generates unnecessary network traffic.
- Increased server load due to frequent requests.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Mobile apps checking for new messages.
- Stock market data updates.

## Webhook vs Polling - Key Differences

| Feature     | Webhook | Polling |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Data Retrieval | Server pushes data | Client requests data |
| Efficiency | High (only triggers when needed) | Low (frequent requests) |
| Latency | Low (real-time) | Higher (depends on polling interval) |
| Implementation Complexity | Requires endpoint & security | Simple to implement |

**Conclusion:**  
Webhooks are preferable for real-time updates and efficiency, whereas polling is useful when webhooks are not feasible.
