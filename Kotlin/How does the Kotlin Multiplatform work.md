# How Does the Kotlin Multiplatform Work?

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) is a feature that enables code sharing across multiple platforms, such as Android, iOS, JVM, JavaScript, and native systems, while still allowing platform-specific implementations when needed.

## Key Components of Kotlin Multiplatform:
  
1. **Common Module**: Contains shared code that can be used across all platforms.
2. **Platform-Specific Modules**: These contain platform-specific implementations when necessary.
3. **Expect/Actual Mechanism**: Allows defining expected declarations in common code and providing actual implementations per platform.
4. **Kotlin Multiplatform Libraries**: Many libraries support KMP, enabling easy integration.
  
## How It Works:
  
- Developers write common logic in a shared module.
- Platform-specific implementations (when required) are handled in separate modules.
- The Kotlin compiler compiles code into platform-specific binaries or JavaScript, depending on the target.

## Benefits of Kotlin Multiplatform:
  
- **Code Reusability**: Reduces duplication and increases maintainability.
- **Interoperability**: Allows seamless integration with existing platform-specific code.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Lets developers decide how much code should be shared.

Kotlin Multiplatform is an efficient way to develop cross-platform applications while maintaining native performance and platform-specific capabilities.
