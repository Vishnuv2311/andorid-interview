# Yield in Kotlin Coroutines

## What is `yield`?
`yield` is a suspending function in Kotlin Coroutines that allows a coroutine to pause its execution and give other coroutines an opportunity to run. It is used to ensure cooperative multitasking within coroutines.

## How `yield` Works
- When a coroutine calls `yield`, it suspends execution and allows other coroutines to execute.
- It helps in achieving fair scheduling among coroutines running on the same dispatcher.
- Unlike `delay`, `yield` does not introduce an artificial delay; it just allows other coroutines to run if they are ready.

## Example of `yield`
```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    launch {
        repeat(5) {
            println("Coroutine 1: $it")
            yield()
        }
    }

    launch {
        repeat(5) {
            println("Coroutine 2: $it")
            yield()
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Coroutine 1: 0
Coroutine 2: 0
Coroutine 1: 1
Coroutine 2: 1
Coroutine 1: 2
Coroutine 2: 2
Coroutine 1: 3
Coroutine 2: 3
Coroutine 1: 4
Coroutine 2: 4
```

## When to Use `yield`
- When you want to ensure fair execution among coroutines.
- When you have long-running operations and want to allow other coroutines to make progress.
- When you want to prevent a single coroutine from blocking other coroutines unnecessarily.

## Key Points
- `yield` only works within coroutine contexts.
- It does not block the thread but simply suspends the coroutine.
- It is useful for cooperative multitasking.

Using `yield` efficiently can improve performance and responsiveness in coroutine-based applications.
