# Apply Scope Function and Its Use Cases in Kotlin

The `apply` scope function in Kotlin is used to configure an object. It executes the given block and returns the original object, making it useful for initializing or modifying objects.

## Syntax:
```kotlin
val user = User().apply {
    name = "John Doe"
    age = 30
}
```

## Use Cases:
1. **Object Initialization**: Setting properties of an object in a concise way.
2. **Builder Pattern Alternative**: Useful in situations where a builder pattern is commonly used.
3. **Chaining Calls**: Helps in chaining multiple operations on an object.
4. **Reducing Boilerplate Code**: Avoids repetitive variable usage.

## Example:
```kotlin
data class Person(var name: String = "", var age: Int = 0)

fun main() {
    val person = Person().apply {
        name = "Alice"
        age = 25
    }
    println(person) // Output: Person(name=Alice, age=25)
}
```

The `apply` function makes code more readable and structured when modifying an object.
