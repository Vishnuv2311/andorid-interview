# Internal Visibility Modifier in Kotlin

## What is the `internal` Modifier?

In Kotlin, the `internal` visibility modifier restricts the visibility of a class, function, property, or object to the same module. A module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together.

## Usage of `internal` Modifier

- The `internal` keyword ensures that the declared element is accessible **only within the same module**.
- This means that if a project has multiple modules, an `internal` class or function in one module will not be accessible from another module.

## Example of `internal` Modifier

```kotlin
// File: MyClass.kt
internal class MyClass {
    internal fun internalFunction() {
        println("This is an internal function")
    }
}

// File: Main.kt (same module)
fun main() {
    val obj = MyClass()
    obj.internalFunction() // Allowed, as it's in the same module
}
```

## When to Use `internal`?

- When you want to **hide implementation details** from other modules but keep them accessible within the same module.
- When working on **multi-module projects**, and you need some elements to be shared within a module but **not exposed to other modules**.

## Limitations of `internal` Modifier

- `internal` members are still **accessible within the module**, which means any file within the same module can use them.
- They are not truly private, so other developers working in the same module can still access them.

## Conclusion

The `internal` modifier is useful for managing access control in **multi-module** Kotlin projects. It ensures that implementation details are **not leaked across module boundaries** while still being accessible where needed.
